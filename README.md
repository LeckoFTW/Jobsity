Tech Challenge - Andres Felipe Gonzalez
=========================
This is the final version of my Jobsity challenge solution.

**node** - 8.4.0 (tested with 6.9.5 too)

**npm** - 5.3.0

## Installation

For run the app, in a terminal execute next steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/LeckoFTW/jobsity.git
cd jobsity
npm install
node index.js
```
you should see the messages : 
"app running at http://localhost:3001".

Then you will be able to access the app in the displayed url

## Fixes from last version
